# Roadmap

## DVP Version 1 (Current Release)
- Additional audit coverage.

## DVP Helper Version 2
- Create a new helper contract V2 to offer more flexible interface to allow AND and OR constructs, similar to patterns used in EVM RPC event searches.

## DVP Version 2
- Gas optimizations and performance improvements.
- A V2 could include support for arbitrary protocols (for example ERC-1155), but allow these to be added in a permissionless way, without needing contract redeploy or upgrades.
